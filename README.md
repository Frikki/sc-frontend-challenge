**Assignment:**

Design and implement a customer management system for the fancy broker agency.

`Rules:`

* You have 4 hours to complete the tasks, be careful with your time, make sure you understand the requirements correctly.
* Try not to over-optimize, an MVP with good documentation counts more than a single polished component.



1. User stories:

* The broker Tom, would like to see a list of his customers.
* The broker Tom, should be able to search in customer data.
* The broker Tom, should be able to see basic statistics over his data.

`Specifications:`

  * The front page should have this structure:
  ```
  [ Home | Contacts | Search | Help ]
  
  [ content ]
  
  [ Footer ]
  ```
* **Home** should render some statistical information about the customers:
  
  1. Customer count.
  2. Average Age.
  3. Standard derivation of the amount they owe the company.
  4. Google Maps with the locations of contacts.
  
* **Contact** section should render a view with 10 customers pro page and you are able to paginate trough the data.

* **Search**  Search section should be able to do a full text search through the data and display the results.

Demo data can be found in `Data.json`

2. Deliverable:

* You can use any language/technology/framework of your choice. But we will ask for the rationale. Since we are using Java Script React, a React app 
 would be a plus!
* The solution should include a comprehensive documentation how to run the app. Keep it simple!
* You can provide a Github link to the solution or send us a tar ball. 


3. Bonus Points when:

* Creating a Docker app for your application.
* Writing tests for the critical parts of the app.
* What are the critical structures of the application, what are the possible bottlenecks, what you would do if you had more time
we are curious of your thoughts! 

_The Bonus points don't have to be delivered on time - you can submit them later!_ 


Looking forward for your result, have fun with this task and good luck!
